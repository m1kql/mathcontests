Suppose that the measurement of time during the day is converted to the metric system so that each day has $10$ metric hours, and each metric hour has $100$ metric minutes. Digital clocks would then be produced that would read $\text{9:99}$ just before midnight, $\text{0:00}$ at midnight, $\text{1:25}$ at the former $\text{3:00}$ AM, and $\text{7:50}$ at the former $\text{6:00}$ PM. After the conversion, a person who wanted to wake up at the equivalent of the former $\text{6:36}$ AM would set his new digital alarm clock for $\text{A:BC}$, where $\text{A}$, $\text{B}$, and $\text{C}$ are digits. Find $100\text{A}+10\text{B}+\text{C}$.
