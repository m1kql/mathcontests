In right triangle $ABC$ with right angle $C$, $CA = 30$ and $CB = 16$.  Its legs $CA$ and $CB$ are extended beyond $A$ and $B$.  Points $O_1$ and $O_2$ lie in the exterior of the triangle and are the centers of two circles with equal radii.  The circle with center $O_1$ is tangent to the hypotenuse and to the extension of leg $CA$, the circle with center $O_2$ is tangent to the hypotenuse and to the extension of leg $CB$, and the circles are externally tangent to each other.  The length of the radius either circle can be expressed as $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $p+q$.
