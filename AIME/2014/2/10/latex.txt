Let $z$ be a complex number with $|z|=2014$. Let $P$ be the polygon in the complex plane whose vertices are $z$ and every $w$ such that $\frac{1}{z+w}=\frac{1}{z}+\frac{1}{w}$. Then the area enclosed by $P$ can be written in the form $n\sqrt{3}$, where $n$ is an integer. Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.
