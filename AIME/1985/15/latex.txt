Three 12 cm $\times$12 cm  squares are each cut into two pieces $A$ and $B$, as shown in the first figure below, by joining the midpoints of two adjacent sides. These six pieces are then attached to a  regular hexagon, as shown in the second figure, so as to fold into a polyhedron. What is the volume (in $\mathrm{cm}^3$) of this polyhedron?
