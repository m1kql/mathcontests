A basketball player has a constant probability of $.4$ of making any given shot, independent of previous shots. Let $a_n$ be the ratio of shots made to shots attempted after $n$ shots. The probability that $a_{10} = .4$ and $a_n\le.4$ for all $n$ such that $1\le n\le9$ is given to be $p^aq^br/\left(s^c\right)$ where $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ are primes, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers. Find $\left(p+q+r+s\right)\left(a+b+c\right)$.
