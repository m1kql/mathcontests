Patio blocks that are hexagons $1$ unit on a side are used to outline a garden by placing the blocks edge to edge with $n$ on each side. The diagram indicates the path of blocks around the garden when $n=5$.
 

 
If $n=202$, then the area of the garden enclosed by the path, not including the path itself, is $m\left(\sqrt3/2\right)$ square units, where $m$ is a positive integer. Find the remainder when $m$ is divided by $1000$.
