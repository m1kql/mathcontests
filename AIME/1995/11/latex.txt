A right rectangular prism $P_{}$ (i.e., a rectangular parallelpiped) has sides of integral length $a, b, c,$ with $a\le b\le c.$  A plane parallel to one of the faces of $P_{}$ cuts $P_{}$ into two prisms, one of which is similar to $P_{},$ and both of which have nonzero volume.  Given that $b=1995,$ for how many ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ does such a plane exist?
