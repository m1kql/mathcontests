The adjoining figure shows two intersecting chords in a circle, with $B$ on minor arc $AD$. Suppose that the radius of the circle is $5$, that $BC=6$, and that $AD$ is bisected by $BC$. Suppose further that $AD$ is the only chord starting at $A$ which is bisected by $BC$. It follows that the sine of the central angle of minor arc $AB$ is a rational number. If this number is expressed as a fraction $\frac{m}{n}$ in lowest terms, what is the product $mn$?
