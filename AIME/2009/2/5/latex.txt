Equilateral triangle $T$ is inscribed in circle $A$, which has radius $10$. Circle $B$ with radius $3$ is internally tangent to circle $A$ at one vertex of $T$. Circles $C$ and $D$, both with radius $2$, are internally tangent to circle $A$ at the other two vertices of $T$. Circles $B$, $C$, and $D$ are all externally tangent to circle $E$, which has radius $\dfrac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
