Suppose that a parabola has vertex $\left(\frac{1}{4},-\frac{9}{8}\right)$ and equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a > 0$ and $a + b + c$ is an integer.  The minimum possible value of $a$ can be written in the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $p + q$.
