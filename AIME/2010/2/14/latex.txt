Triangle $ABC$ with right angle at $C$, $\angle BAC < 45^\circ$ and $AB = 4$. Point $P$ on $\overline{AB}$ is chosen such that $\angle APC = 2\angle ACP$ and $CP = 1$. The ratio $\frac{AP}{BP}$ can be represented in the form $p + q\sqrt{r}$, where $p$, $q$, $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $p+q+r$.
