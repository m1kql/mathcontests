Hexagon $ABCDEF$ is divided into five rhombuses, $\mathcal{P, Q, R, S,}$ and $\mathcal{T,}$ as shown. Rhombuses $\mathcal{P, Q, R,}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ are  congruent, and each has area $\sqrt{2006}.$ Let $K$ be the area of rhombus $\mathcal{T}$.  Given that $K$ is a positive integer, find the number of possible values for $K$.
