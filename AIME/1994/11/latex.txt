Ninety-four bricks, each measuring $4''\times10''\times19'',$ are to be stacked one on top of another to form a tower 94 bricks tall.  Each brick can be oriented so it contributes $4''\,$ or $10''\,$ or $19''\,$ to the total height of the tower.  How many different tower heights can be achieved using all ninety-four of the bricks?
