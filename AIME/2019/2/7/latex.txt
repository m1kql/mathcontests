Triangle $ABC$ has side lengths $AB=120,BC=220$, and $AC=180$. Lines $\ell_A,\ell_B$, and $\ell_C$ are drawn parallel to $\overline{BC},\overline{AC}$, and $\overline{AB}$, respectively, such that the intersections of $\ell_A,\ell_B$, and $\ell_C$ with the interior of $\triangle ABC$ are segments of lengths $55,45$, and $15$, respectively. Find the perimeter of the triangle whose sides lie on lines $\ell_A,\ell_B$, and $\ell_C$.
