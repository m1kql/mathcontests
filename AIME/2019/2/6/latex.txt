In a Martian civilization, all logarithms whose bases are not specified as assumed to be base $b$, for some fixed $b\ge2$. A Martian student writes down
 
 \begin{center} \[3\log(\sqrt{x}\log x)=56\] \end{center} 
 
 \begin{center} \[\log_{\log x}(x)=54\] \end{center} 
 
and finds that this system of equations has a single real number solution $x>1$. Find $b$.
