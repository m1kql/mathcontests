Let $P(x) = x+2x^{2}+3x^{3} \dots 24x^{24}+23x^{25}+22x^{26} \dots x^{47}$. Let $z_{1},z_{2},\ldots,z_{r}$ be the distinct zeros of $P(x),$ and let $z_{k}^{2} = a_{k} + b_{k}i$ for $k = 1,2,\ldots,r,$ where $a_{k}$ and $b_{k}$ are real numbers. Let
 
$\sum_{k = 1}^{r}|b_{k}| = m + n\sqrt {p},$where $m, n,$ and $p$ are integers and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n + p.$
