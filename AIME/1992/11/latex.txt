Lines $l_1^{}$ and $l_2^{}$ both pass through the origin and make first-quadrant angles of $\frac{\pi}{70}$ and $\frac{\pi}{54}$ radians, respectively, with the positive x-axis. For any line $l^{}_{}$, the transformation $R(l)^{}_{}$ produces another line as follows: $l^{}_{}$ is reflected in $l_1^{}$, and the resulting line is reflected in $l_2^{}$. Let $R^{(1)}(l)=R(l)^{}_{}$ and $R^{(n)}(l)^{}_{}=R\left(R^{(n-1)}(l)\right)$. Given that $l^{}_{}$ is the line $y=\frac{19}{92}x^{}_{}$, find the smallest positive integer $m^{}_{}$ for which $R^{(m)}(l)=l^{}_{}$.
