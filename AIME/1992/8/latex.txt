For any sequence of real numbers $A=(a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots)$, define $\Delta A^{}_{}$ to be the sequence $(a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2,a_4-a_3,\ldots)$, whose $n^{\mbox{th}}_{}$ term is $a_{n+1}-a_n^{}$. Suppose that all of the terms of the sequence $\Delta(\Delta A^{}_{})$ are $1^{}_{}$, and that $a_{19}=a_{92}^{}=0$. Find $a_1^{}$.
