Let $S^{}_{}$ be the set of all rational numbers $r^{}_{}$, $0^{}_{}<r<1$, that have a repeating decimal expansion in the form $0.abcabcabc\ldots=0.\overline{abc}$, where the digits $a^{}_{}$, $b^{}_{}$, and $c^{}_{}$ are not necessarily distinct. To write the elements of $S^{}_{}$ as fractions in lowest terms, how many different numerators are required?
