Two concentric circles have radii $1$ and $2$. Two points on the outer circle are chosen independently and uniformly at random. What is the probability that the chord joining the two points intersects the inner circle?
 
$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{6}\qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{4}\qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \frac{2-\sqrt{2}}{2}\qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{3}\qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \frac{1}{2}\qquad$
