Two real numbers are selected independently and at random from the interval $[-20,10]$.  What is the probability that the product of those numbers is greater than zero?
 
$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{9} \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{3} \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ \frac{4}{9} \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ \frac{5}{9} \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ \frac{2}{3}$
