A pair of standard 6-sided fair dice is rolled once.  The sum of the numbers rolled determines the diameter of a circle.  What is the probability that the numerical value of the area of the circle is less than the numerical value of the circle's circumference?
 
$\text{(A)}\,\frac{1}{36} \qquad\text{(B)}\,\frac{1}{12} \qquad\text{(C)}\,\frac{1}{6} \qquad\text{(D)}\,\frac{1}{4} \qquad\text{(E)}\,\frac{5}{18}$
