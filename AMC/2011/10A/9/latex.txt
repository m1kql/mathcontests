A rectangular region is bounded by the graphs of the equations $y=a, y=-b, x=-c,$ and $x=d$, where $a,b,c,$ and $d$ are all positive numbers. Which of the following represents the area of this region?
 
$\textbf{(A)}\ ac+ad+bc+bd\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ ac-ad+bc-bd\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ ac+ad-bc-bd   \quad\quad\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ -ac-ad+bc+bd\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ ac-ad-bc+bd$
