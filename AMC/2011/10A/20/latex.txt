Two points on the circumference of a circle of radius $r$ are selected independently and at random. From each point a chord of length $r$ is drawn in a clockwise direction. What is the probability that the two chords intersect?
 
$\textbf{(A)}\ \frac{1}{6}\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{5}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{1}{4}\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{3}\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{1}{2}$
