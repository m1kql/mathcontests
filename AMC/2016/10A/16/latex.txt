A triangle with vertices $A(0, 2)$, $B(-3, 2)$, and $C(-3, 0)$ is reflected about the $x$-axis, then the image $\triangle A'B'C'$ is rotated counterclockwise about the origin by $90^{\circ}$ to produce $\triangle A''B''C''$. Which of the following transformations will return $\triangle A''B''C''$ to $\triangle ABC$?
 
$\textbf{(A)}$ counterclockwise rotation about the origin by $90^{\circ}$. 
 
$\textbf{(B)}$ clockwise rotation about the origin by $90^{\circ}$. 
 
$\textbf{(C)}$ reflection about the $x$-axis 
 
$\textbf{(D)}$ reflection about the line $y = x$
 
$\textbf{(E)}$ reflection about the $y$-axis.
