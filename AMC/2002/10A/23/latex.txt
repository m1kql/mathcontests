Points $A,B,C$ and $D$ lie on a line, in that order, with $AB = CD$ and $BC = 12$. Point $E$ is not on the line, and $BE = CE = 10$. The perimeter of $\triangle AED$ is twice the perimeter of $\triangle BEC$. Find $AB$.
 
$\text{(A)}\ 15/2 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 8 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 17/2 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 9 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 19/2$
