Cassandra sets her watch to the correct time at noon. At the actual time of 1:00 PM, she notices that her watch reads 12:57 and 36 seconds. Assuming that her watch loses time at a constant rate, what will be the actual time when her
 
watch first reads 10:00 PM?
 
$\text {(A) 10:22 PM and 24 seconds}  \qquad \text {(B) 10:24 PM} \qquad \text {(C) 10:25 PM}  \qquad \text {(D) 10:27 PM}  \qquad \text {(E) 10:30 PM}$
