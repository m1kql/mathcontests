Let $S$ be the set of permutations of the sequence $1,2,3,4,5$ for which the first term is not $1$. A permutation is chosen randomly from $S$. The probability that the second term is $2$, in lowest terms, is $a/b$. What is $a+b$? 
 
$\mathrm{(A)}\ 5 \qquad\mathrm{(B)}\ 6 \qquad\mathrm{(C)}\ 11 \qquad\mathrm{(D)}\ 16 \qquad\mathrm{(E)}\ 19$
