Right triangles $T_1$ and $T_2$, have areas of 1 and 2, respectively. A side of $T_1$ is congruent to a side of $T_2$, and a different side of $T_1$ is congruent to a different side of $T_2$. What is the square of the product of the lengths of the other (third) side of $T_1$ and $T_2$?
 
$\textbf{(A) }\frac{28}{3}\qquad\textbf{(B) }10\qquad\textbf{(C) }\frac{32}{3}\qquad\textbf{(D) }\frac{34}{3}\qquad\textbf{(E) }12$
