JoAnn added 2 ounces of cream, stirred the coffee well, and then drank 2 ounces.  What is the resulting ratio of the amount of cream in Joe's coffee to that in JoAnn's coffee?
 
$\text {(A) } \frac 67 \qquad \text {(B) } \frac {13}{14} \qquad \text {(C) } 1 \qquad \text {(D) } \frac {14}{13} \qquad \text {(E) } \frac 76$
