Elmo makes $N$ sandwiches for a fundraiser. For each sandwich he uses $B$ globs of peanut butter at $4$ cents per glob and $J$ blobs of jam at $5$ cents per glob. The cost of the peanut butter and jam to make all the sandwiches is $2.53$. Assume that $B$, $J$ and $N$ are all positive integers with $N>1$. What is the cost of the jam Elmo uses to make the sandwiches?
