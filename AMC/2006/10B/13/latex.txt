Joe and JoAnn each bought 12 ounces of coffee in a 16 ounce cup. Joe drank 2 ounces of his coffee and then added 2 ounces of cream. JoAnn added 2 ounces of cream, stirred the coffee well, and then drank 2 ounces. What is the resulting ratio of the amount of cream in Joe's coffee to that in JoAnn's coffee? 
 
$\mathrm{(A) \ } \frac{6}{7}\qquad \mathrm{(B) \ } \frac{13}{14}\qquad \mathrm{(C) \ }1 \qquad \mathrm{(D) \ } \frac{14}{13}\qquad \mathrm{(E) \ } \frac{7}{6}$
