Three circles of radius $s$ are drawn in the first quadrant of the $xy$-plane. The first circle is tangent to both axes, the second is tangent to the first circle and the $x$-axis, and the third is tangent to the first circle and the $y$-axis. A circle of radius $r > s$ is tangent to both axes and to the second and third circles. What is $r/s$?
