Let $S$ be the set of all points with coordinates $(x,y,z)$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are each chosen from the set $\{0,1,2\}$. How many equilateral triangles all have their vertices in $S$?
 
$(\mathrm {A}) \ 72\qquad (\mathrm {B}) \ 76 \qquad (\mathrm {C})\ 80 \qquad (\mathrm {D}) \ 84 \qquad (\mathrm {E})\ 88$
