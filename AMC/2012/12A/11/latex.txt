Alex, Mel, and Chelsea play a game that has $6$ rounds.  In each round there is a single winner, and the outcomes of the rounds are independent.  For each round the probability that Alex wins is $\frac{1}{2}$, and Mel is twice as likely to win as Chelsea.  What is the probability that Alex wins three rounds, Mel wins two rounds, and Chelsea wins one round?
