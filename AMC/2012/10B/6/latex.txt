In order to estimate the value of $x-y$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers with $x > y > 0$, Xiaoli rounded $x$ up by a small amount, rounded $y$ down by the same amount, and then subtracted her rounded values. Which of the following statements is necessarily correct? 
 

 
$\textbf{(A) } \text{Her estimate is larger than } x-y \qquad \textbf{(B) } \text{Her estimate is smaller than } x-y \qquad \textbf{(C) } \text{Her estimate equals } x-y \\ \qquad \textbf{(D) } \text{Her estimate equals } x-y \qquad \textbf{(E) } \text{Her estimate is } 0$
