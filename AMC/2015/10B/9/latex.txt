The shaded region below is called a shark's fin falcata, a figure studied by Leonardo da Vinci. It is bounded by the portion of the circle of radius $3$ and center $(0,0)$ that lies in the first quadrant, the portion of the circle with radius $\tfrac{3}{2}$ and center $(0,\tfrac{3}{2})$ that lies in the first quadrant, and the line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(3,0)$. What is the area of the shark's fin falcata?
 

 
$\textbf{(A) } \dfrac{4\pi}{5} \qquad\textbf{(B) } \dfrac{9\pi}{8} \qquad\textbf{(C) } \dfrac{4\pi}{3} \qquad\textbf{(D) } \dfrac{7\pi}{5} \qquad\textbf{(E) } \dfrac{3\pi}{2}$
