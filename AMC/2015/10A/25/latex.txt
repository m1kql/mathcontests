Let $S$ be a square of side length $1$. Two points are chosen independently at random on the sides of $S$. The probability that the straight-line distance between the points is at least $\frac{1}{2}$ is $\frac{a-b\pi}{c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers with $\gcd(a,b,c)=1$. What is $a+b+c$?

$\textbf{(A) }59\qquad\textbf{(B) }60\qquad\textbf{(C) }61\qquad\textbf{(D) }62\qquad\textbf{(E) }63$
