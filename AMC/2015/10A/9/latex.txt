Two right circular cylinders have the same volume. The radius of the second cylinder is $10\%$ more than the radius of the first. What is the relationship between the heights of the two cylinders?
 
$\textbf{(A)}\  \text{The second height is } 10\% \text{ less than the first.} \\ \textbf{(B)}\  \text{The first height is } 10\% \text{ more than the second.}\\ \textbf{(C)}\ \text{The second height is } 21\% \text{ less than the first.} \\ \textbf{(D)}\ \text{The first height is } 21\% \text{ more than the second.}\\ \textbf{(E)}\ \text{The second height is } 80\% \text{ of the first.}$
