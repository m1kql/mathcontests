A telephone number has the form $\text{ABC-DEF-GHIJ}$, where each letter represents
 
a different digit. The digits in each part of the number are in decreasing
 
order; that is, $A > B > C$, $D > E > F$, and $G > H > I > J$. Furthermore,
 
$D$, $E$, and $F$ are consecutive even digits; $G$, $H$, $I$, and $J$ are consecutive odd
 
digits; and $A + B + C = 9$. Find $A$.
 
$\text{(A)}\ 4\qquad \text{(B)}\ 5\qquad \text{(C)}\ 6\qquad \text{(D)}\ 7\qquad \text{(E)}\ 8$
