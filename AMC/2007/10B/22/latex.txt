A player chooses one of the numbers $1$ through $4$. After the choice has been made, two regular four-sided (tetrahedral) dice are rolled, with the sides of the dice numbered $1$ through $4.$ If the number chosen appears on the bottom of exactly one die after it has been rolled, then the player wins $1$ dollar. If the number chosen appears on the bottom of both of the dice, then the player wins $2$ dollars. If the number chosen does not appear on the bottom of either of the dice, the player loses $1$ dollar. What is the expected return to the player, in dollars, for one roll of the dice?
 
$\textbf{(A) } -\frac{1}{8} \qquad\textbf{(B) } -\frac{1}{16} \qquad\textbf{(C) } 0 \qquad\textbf{(D) } \frac{1}{16} \qquad\textbf{(E) } \frac{1}{8}$
