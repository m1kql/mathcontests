The wheel shown is spun twice, and the randomly determined numbers opposite the pointer are recorded. The first number is divided by $4,$ and the second number is divided by $5.$ The first remainder designates a column, and the second remainder designates a row on the checkerboard shown. What is the probability that the pair of numbers designates a shaded square?
 
$\textbf{(A) } \frac{1}{3} \qquad\textbf{(B) } \frac{4}{9} \qquad\textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{2} \qquad\textbf{(D) } \frac{5}{9} \qquad\textbf{(E) } \frac{2}{3}$
