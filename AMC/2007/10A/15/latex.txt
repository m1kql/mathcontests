Three circles are inscribed in a rectangle of width w and height h as shown. Two
 
of the circles are congruent and are each tangent to two adjacent sides of the
 
rectangle and to each other. The other circle is larger and is tangent to three sides
 
of the rectangle and to the two smaller circles. What the ratio of h to w? Express
 
your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
 
Four circles of radius $1$ are each tangent to two sides of a square and externally tangent to a circle of radius $2$, as shown. What is the area of the square?
 

 

 

 
$\text{(A)}\ 32 \qquad \text{(B)}\ 22 + 12\sqrt {2}\qquad \text{(C)}\ 16 + 16\sqrt {3}\qquad \text{(D)}\ 48 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 36 + 16\sqrt {2}$
