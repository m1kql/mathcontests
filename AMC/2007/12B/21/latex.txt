The first $2007$ positive integers are each written in base $3$. How many of these base-$3$ representations are palindromes? (A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward.)
 
$\mathrm {(A)}\ 100 \qquad \mathrm {(B)}\ 101 \qquad \mathrm {(C)}\ 102 \qquad \mathrm {(D)}\ 103 \qquad \mathrm {(E)}\ 104$
