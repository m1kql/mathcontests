A group of $12$ pirates agree to divide a treasure chest of gold coins among themselves as follows.  The $k^{\text{th}}$ pirate to take a share takes $\frac{k}{12}$ of the coins that remain in the chest.  The number of coins initially in the chest is the smallest number for which this arrangement will allow each pirate to receive a positive whole number of coins.  How many coins does the $12^{\text{th}}$ pirate receive?
