A wire is cut into two pieces, one of length $a$ and the other of length $b$. The piece of length $a$ is bent to form an equilateral triangle, and the piece of length $b$ is bent to form a regular hexagon. The triangle and the hexagon have equal area. What is $\frac{a}{b}$?
 
$\textbf{(A)}\ 1\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \sqrt{3} \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 2\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}$
