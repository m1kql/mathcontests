Angelina drove at an average rate of $80$ kmh and then stopped $20$ minutes for gas. After the stop, she drove at an average rate of $100$ kmh. Altogether she drove $250$ km in a total trip time of $3$ hours including the stop. Which equation could be used to solve for the time $t$ in hours that she drove before her stop?
 
$\textbf{(A)}\ 80t+100\left(\frac{8}{3}-t\right)=250 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 80t=250 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 100t=250 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 90t=250 \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 80\left(\frac{8}{3}-t\right)+100t=250$
