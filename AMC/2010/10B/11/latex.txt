A shopper plans to purchase an item that has a listed price greater than \textdollar 100 and can use any one of the three coupons. Coupon A gives $15\%$ off the listed price, Coupon B gives \textdollar 30 off the listed price, and Coupon C gives $25\%$ off the amount by which the listed price exceeds \textdollar 100.
Let $x$ and $y$ be the smallest and largest prices, respectively, for which Coupon A saves at least as many dollars as Coupon B or C. What is $y - x$?

$\textbf{(A)}\ 50 \qquad \textbf{(B)}\ 60 \qquad \textbf{(C)}\ 75 \qquad \textbf{(D)}\ 80  \qquad \textbf{(E)}\ 100$
