A square has sides of length $10$, and a circle centered at one of its vertices has radius $10$. What is the area of the union of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle?
 
$\mathrm{(A)\ }200+25\pi\quad\mathrm{(B)\ }100+75\pi\quad\mathrm{(C)\ }75+100\pi\quad\mathrm{(D)\ }100+100\pi\quad\mathrm{(E)\ }100+125\pi$
