The data set $[6, 19, 33, 33, 39, 41, 41, 43, 51, 57]$ has median $Q_2 = 40$, first quartile $Q_1 = 33$, and third quartile $Q_3 = 43$. An outlier in a data set is a value that is more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range below the first quartle ($Q_1$) or more than $1.5$ times the interquartile range above the third quartile ($Q_3$), where the interquartile range is defined as $Q_3 - Q_1$.
