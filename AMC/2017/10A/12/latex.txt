Let $S$ be a set of points $(x,y)$ in the coordinate plane such that two of the three quantities $3,~x+2,$ and $y-4$ are equal and the third of the three quantities is no greater than this common value. Which of the following is a correct description for $S?$
 
$\textbf{(A)}\ \text{a single point} \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ \text{two intersecting lines} \\\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ \text{three lines whose pairwise intersections are three distinct points} \\\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ \text{a triangle} \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ \text{three rays with a common endpoint}$
