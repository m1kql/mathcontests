Minnie rides on a flat road at $20$ kilometers per hour (kph), downhill at $30$ kph, and uphill at $5$ kph. Penny rides on a flat road at $30$ kph, downhill at $40$ kph, and uphill at $10$ kph. Minnie goes from town $A$ to town $B$, a distance of $10$ km all uphill, then from town $B$ to town $C$, a distance of $15$ km all downhill, and then back to town $A$, a distance of $20$ km on the flat. Penny goes the other way around using the same route. How many more minutes does it take Minnie to complete the $45$-km ride than it takes Penny?
