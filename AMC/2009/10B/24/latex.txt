The keystone arch is an ancient architectural feature. It is composed of congruent isosceles trapezoids fitted together along the non-parallel sides, as shown. The bottom sides of the two end trapezoids are horizontal. In an arch made with $9$ trapezoids, let $x$ be the angle measure in degrees of the larger interior angle of the trapezoid. What is $x$?
