On each side of a unit square, an equilateral triangle of side length 1 is constructed. On each new side of each equilateral triangle, another equilateral triangle of side length 1 is constructed. The interiors of the square and the 12 triangles have no points in common. Let $R$ be the region formed by the union of the square and all the triangles, and $S$ be the smallest convex polygon that contains $R$. What is the area of the region that is inside $S$ but outside $R$?
