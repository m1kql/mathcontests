$(*)$ Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle ABC$ obtuse. The $A$-excircle is a circle in the exterior of $\triangle ABC$ that is tangent to side $\overline{BC}$ of the triangle and tangent to the extensions of the other two sides. Let $E$, $F$ be the feet of the altitudes from $B$ and $C$ to lines $AC$ and $AB$, respectively. Can line $EF$ be tangent to the $A$-excircle?
