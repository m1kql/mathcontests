Points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ lie on a circle $\omega$ and point $P$ lies outside the circle.  The given points are such that (i) lines $PB$ and $PD$ are tangent to $\omega$, (ii) $P$, $A$, $C$ are collinear, and (iii) $\overline{DE} \parallel \overline{AC}$.  Prove that $\overline{BE}$ bisects $\overline{AC}$.
