A word is defined as any finite string of letters.  A word is a palindrome if it reads the same backwards as forwards.  Let a sequence of words $W_0$, $W_1$, $W_2$, $\dots$ be defined as follows: $W_0 = a$, $W_1 = b$, and for $n \ge 2$, $W_n$ is the word formed by writing $W_{n - 2}$ followed by $W_{n - 1}$.  Prove that for any $n \ge 1$, the word formed by writing $W_1$, $W_2$, $\dots$, $W_n$ in succession is a palindrome.
