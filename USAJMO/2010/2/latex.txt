Let $n > 1$ be an integer. Find, with proof, all sequences
$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}$ of positive integers with the following
three properties:
 \begin{itemize} \item  (a). $x_1 < x_2 < \cdots <x_{n-1}$;
 \item  (b). $x_i +x_{n-i} = 2n$ for all $i=1,2,\ldots,n-1$;
 \item  (c). given any two indices $i$ and $j$ (not necessarily distinct)
for which $x_i + x_j < 2n$, there is an index $k$ such
that $x_i+x_j = x_k$.
 \end{itemize}
