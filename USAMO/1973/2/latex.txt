Let $\{X_n\}$ and $\{Y_n\}$ denote two sequences of integers defined as follows:
 $X_0=1$, $X_1=1$, $X_{n+1}=X_n+2X_{n-1}$ $(n=1,2,3,\dots),$$Y_0=1$, $Y_1=7$, $Y_{n+1}=2Y_n+3Y_{n-1}$ $(n=1,2,3,\dots)$.Thus, the first few terms of the sequences are:
 $X:1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, \dots$, $Y:1, 7, 17, 55, 161, 487, \dots$.Prove that, except for the "1", there is no term which occurs in both sequences.
