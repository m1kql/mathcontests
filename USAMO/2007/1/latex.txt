(Sam Vandervelde) Let $n$ be a positive integer.  Define a sequence by setting $a_1 = n$ and, for each $k>1$, letting $a_k$ be the unique integer in the range $0 \le a_k \le k-1$ for which $a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k$ is divisible by $k$.  For instance, when $n=9$ the obtained sequence is $9, 1, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, \ldots$.  Prove that for any $n$ the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ eventually becomes constant.
