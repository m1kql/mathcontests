Prove that there exists an infinite set of points  \begin{center} \[\ldots,\,\,\,\,P_{-3},\,\,\,\,P_{-2},\,\,\,\,P_{-1},\,\,\,\,P_0,\,\,\,\,P_1,\,\,\,\,P_2,\,\,\,\,P_3,\,\,\,\,\ldots\] \end{center}  in the plane with the following property: For any three distinct integers $a,b,$ and $c$, points $P_a$, $P_b$, and $P_c$ are collinear if and only if $a+b+c=2014$.
