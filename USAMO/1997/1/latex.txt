Let $p_1,p_2,p_3,...$ be the prime numbers listed in increasing order, and let $x_0$ be a real number between $0$ and $1$. For positive integer $k$, define
$x_{k}=\begin{cases}0&\text{ if }x_{k-1}=0\\ \left\{\frac{p_{k}}{x_{k-1}}\right\}&\text{ if }x_{k-1}\ne0\end{cases}$
where $\{x\}$ denotes the fractional part of $x$. (The fractional part of $x$ is given by $x-\lfloor{x}\rfloor$ where $\lfloor{x}\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.) Find, with proof, all $x_0$ satisfying $0<x_0<1$ for which the sequence $x_0,x_1,x_2,...$ eventually becomes $0$.
