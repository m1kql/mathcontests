(Zuming Feng) Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle, and let $P$ and $Q$ be two points on side $BC$. Construct point $C_1$ in such a way that convex quadrilateral $APBC_1$ is cyclic, $QC_1 \parallel CA$, and $C_1$ and $Q$ lie on opposite sides of line $AB$. Construct point $B_1$ in such a way that convex quadrilateral $APCB_1$ is cyclic, $QB_1 \parallel BA$, and $B_1$ and $Q$  lie on opposite sides of line $AC$.  Prove that points $B_1, C_1,P$, and $Q$ lie on a circle.
