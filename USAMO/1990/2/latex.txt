A sequence of functions $\, \{f_n(x) \} \,$ is defined recursively as follows:
 \begin{center} \begin{align*} f_1(x) &= \sqrt {x^2 + 48}, \quad \text{and} \\ f_{n + 1}(x) &= \sqrt {x^2 + 6f_n(x)} \quad \text{for } n \geq 1. \end{align*} \end{center} 
(Recall that $\sqrt {\makebox[5mm]{}}$ is understood to represent the positive square root.) For each positive integer $n$, find all real solutions of the equation $\, f_n(x) = 2x \,$.
