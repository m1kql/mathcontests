A certain state issues license plates consisting of six digits (from 0 through 9). The state requires that any two plates differ in at least two places. (Thus the plates $\boxed{027592}$ and $\boxed{020592}$ cannot both be used.) Determine, with proof, the maximum number of distinct license plates that the state can use.
