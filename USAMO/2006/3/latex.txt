(Titu Andreescu, Gabriel Dospinescu) For integral $m$, let $p(m)$ be the greatest prime divisor of $m$. By convention, we set $p(\pm 1)=1$ and $p(0)=\infty$. Find all polynomials $f$ with integer coefficients such that the sequence $\{ p(f(n^2))-2n) \}_{n\ge 0}$ is bounded above. (In particular, this requires $f(n^2)\neq 0$ for $n\ge 0$.)
