Let $S$ be a set with 2002 elements, and let $N$ be an integer with $0 \le N \le 2^{2002}$.  Prove that it is possible to color every subset of $S$ either blue or red so that the following conditions hold:
(a) the union of any two red subsets is red;
(b) the union of any two blue subsets is blue;
(c) there are exactly $N$ red subsets.
