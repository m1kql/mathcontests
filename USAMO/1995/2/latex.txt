A calculator is broken so that the only keys that still work are the $\, \sin, \; \cos,$ $\tan, \; \sin^{-1}, \; \cos^{-1}, \,$ and $\, \tan^{-1} \,$ buttons.  The display initially shows 0. Given any positive rational number $\, q, \,$ show that pressing some finite sequence of buttons will yield $\, q$.   Assume that the calculator does real number calculations with infinite precision.  All functions are in terms of radians.
