Let $A$ be a set with $|A| = 225$, meaning that $A$ has 225 elements.  Suppose further that there are eleven subsets $A_1$, $\dots$, $A_{11}$ of $A$ such that $|A_i | = 45$ for $1 \le i \le 11$ and $|A_i \cap A_j| = 9$ for $1 \le i < j \le 11$.  Prove that $|A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \dots \cup A_{11}| \ge 165$, and give an example for which equality holds.
